"""
Utility script to launch both the backend (FastAPI / Uvicorn) and the frontend (Vite / React)
in a single command: `python run.py`.

The script will:
1. Spawn the backend with hot-reload enabled.
2. Spawn the frontend dev server.
3. Keep running until you press Ctrl-C, after which it will shut down both processes.
